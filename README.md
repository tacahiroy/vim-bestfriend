bestfriend.vim
============

Who is the your best friend?
If you want to know, this is an answer.

This plugin is not so practical, but might provide a bit interest:)

How to install
-------------
If you use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git) it's very easy, you just run command `:BundleInstall tacahiroy/vim-bestfriend`
inside vim.  
And also put `Bundle 'tacahiroy/vim-bestfriend'` into `.vimrc`.

If you use [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), you just execute following:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/tacahiroy/vim-bestfriend.git
